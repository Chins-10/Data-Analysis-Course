# Data-Analysis-Course
Hi!
I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2024.
The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:
+ Python
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ SQL
+ Statistics
+ Tableau
+ R Studio
List of projects:
+ [SQL Tasks](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/blob/main/sql_tasks.ipynb) -- SQL exercises done by me while passing this data analysis course.
+ [Customer Segmentation]() -- Customer segmentation stands out as a vital utilization of unsupervised learning. By employing clustering methodologies, businesses can delineate various customer segments, enabling them to focus on potential user groups. In this particular machine learning endeavor, our aim is to utilize k-means clustering, a fundamental algorithm for categorizing unlabeled datasets.
