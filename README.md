# Data-Analysis-Course
Hi!
I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2024.
The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:
+ Python
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ SQL
+ Statistics
+ Tableau
+ R Studio
List of projects:
+ [SQL Tasks](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/blob/main/sql_tasks.ipynb) -- SQL exercises done by me while passing this data analysis course.
+ [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/tree/main/customer_seg) -- Customer segmentation stands out as a vital utilization of unsupervised learning. By employing clustering methodologies, businesses can delineate various customer segments, enabling them to focus on potential user groups. In this particular machine learning endeavor, our aim is to utilize k-means clustering, a fundamental algorithm for categorizing unlabeled datasets.
+ [Amazing Mart Dashboard](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/tree/main/as1) -- The dashboard requirements are as follows:
1.	Show two filters- Category, Region. These filters should have only relevant values.
2.	The dashboard should have the title “Executive sales Performance”
3.	The first chart should have the title “YTS KPIs” and should show the following-
Donut of category Sales in each Region
4.	The second graph should have the title as “Sales” and should show monthly sales per year. Make sure it is an area chart with proper formatting.
5.	The third graph should the title as “Profit” and should show monthly profit per year. Make sure it is an area chart with proper formatting.
6.	Fourth graph will show the Sales and target Achieved
7.	Do proper formatting so that it can look professional
+  [Covid-19 Stats using python](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/blob/main/covid_19_Interactive_dashboard.ipynb): Found different stats to understand the data in a better way.
+  [Product and Retail Data Analysis](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course/tree/main/P%26R): Analysing the complete [Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cjmmhzg3x83e53n/AABb7IToMY88A-kh1Cezz61da/ecommerce_data.csv?dl=0) using Python.
Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
